# Brainfix v2.0
This is a reboot of a little project I did as a student. BrainFix is a compiler that takes a C-style
language (with elements taken from other languages or designed to match the needs) and compiles this
into [BrainF*ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), an esoteric programming language consisting of only 8 operations.
