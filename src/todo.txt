[ ] consteval should take into account the int-type
[x] Bounds checking for known index --> warning or error?
[-] assignElement -> when done at runtime, it returns the index of the RHS. Return -1 (void instead)?.
    opted out -> this behaviour is fine
[x] implement while*
[x] make constant evaluation a compiler option (maybe -O0, -O1?)
[ ] rename compilerError to error -> see if error() generated by bisonc++ can have other name
[ ] implement optimizing function that reduces e.g. +++++++.[-]+++++ to +++++++.--
    OR revisit keeping track of runtime values and using these to optimize runtimeSetToValue()
[ ] Constants are still needed for O0 generation. However, it should be possible to have array-sizes
    specified by variables known at compile-time.
[ ] remove __bf and __movePtr
[ ] Update readme
    - for*
    - while*
    - new array init syntax: #{}
    - difference between O0 and O1
    - section "Numbers"
    - indexing: bounds check
    - array-size specification --> if implemented, possible using 'normal' variables
