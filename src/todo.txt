[ ] consteval should take into account the int-type
[ ] When a cell is desynced, remember the last runtime-value.
    Then implement a setToValue() function that takes into account the current
    runtime value to optimize the number of +'s (or -'s) necessary.
[ ] Bounds checking for known index --> warning or error?
[ ] assignElement -> when done at runtime, it returns the index of the RHS. Return -1 (void instead).
[ ] implement while*
[ ] make constant evaluation a compiler option (maybe -O0, -O1?)
