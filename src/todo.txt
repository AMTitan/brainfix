[ ] consteval should take into account the int-type
[ ] Bounds checking for known index --> warning or error?
[ ] assignElement -> when done at runtime, it returns the index of the RHS. Return -1 (void instead).
[x] implement while*
[ ] make constant evaluation a compiler option (maybe -O0, -O1?)
[ ] rename compilerError to error -> see if error() generated by bisonc++ can have other name
[ ] implement optimizing function that reduces e.g. +++++++.[-]+++++ to +++++++.--
    OR revisit keeping track of runtime values and using these to optimize runtimeSetToValue()
